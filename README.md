Hey ! great brains 👋, It's Harsh Sonegra on the other side of your screen 📱.I've been consuming oxygen from the atmosphere for the last 18 years 🧑‍🎓. I've completed my Diploma in Computer Engineering 💻 from Government Polytechnic, Porbandar and I'm currently pursuing my second year of Bachelors' in CSE ( Data Science ) from Vishwakarma Government Engineering College, Chandkheda. Mostly you'll find me talking about web development 💻, and Machine Learning 📊, and Algorithm Optimization 📈 Besides this, you may find me singing 🎤, dancing 🕺, reading a good book 📖, or playing Chess ♟️. I am looking forward to engaging with more students and professionals, expanding my network. I am excited to exchange insights and knowledge! Let me share a good line with you.. 

If We both have an apple and we exchange it, We both will still have one apple each but If we both have an idea and we exchange it we both will have 2 ideas. So let's just grow and share our thoughts and improve exponentially !
