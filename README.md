Hey ! great brains 👋*, It's *Harsh Sonegra* on the other side of your screen 📱.I've been consuming oxygen from the atmosphere for the last 18 years 🧑‍🎓. I've completed my Diploma in *Computer Engineering*  💻 from Government Polytechnic, Porbandar and I'm currently pursuing my pre-final year of *Bachelors' in CSE ( Data Science )* from Vishwakarma Government Engineering College, Chandkheda. Mostly you'll find me talking about *web development 💻, and Machine Learning 📊, and Algorithm Optimization* 📈 Besides this, you may find me *singing 🎤, dancing 🕺, reading a good book 📖, or playing Chess* ♟️. I am looking forward to engaging with more students and expanding my network. I am excited to exchange insights and knowledge! Let me share a good line with you..
